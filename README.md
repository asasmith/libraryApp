# libraryApp
a basic library app built for [The Odin Project's JS track](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library)

I used [Shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/) for basic styling

The code could be orgainized better. Considering using the module pattern to refactor. Also, needs unit tests.
